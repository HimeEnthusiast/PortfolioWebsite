NoteTube is an Android app that allows users to save youtube videos by linking them, then creating notes for that video. The videos are saved as documents that can be titled and searched, and each document has its own page that contains all of the notes belonging to it. Notes can be written manually or by using speech to text dictation. 

I put together the front end of the project, while a partner was responsible for the backend. This is one of the most complicated android application I've made. I learned about a lot of new features that I haven't used before, such as Dialog fragments and using text to speech. There were features of the app that we had no choice but to sacrifice due to a lack of time, such as time stamps for notes to correspond with the video and a custom text display for the text to speech feature.
