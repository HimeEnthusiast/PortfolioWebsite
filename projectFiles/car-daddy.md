Car Daddy is an iOS app that takes the effort out of maintaining your car. By submitting your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), CarDaddy can obtain your vehicle's maintenence schedule and use it to keep track of everything your car needs for you. /// Then, users are able to input their own maintenence and repair items, as well as readjust their recommended schedule to fit their own needs. Then, the app will provide you with notifications for when your mentenence is due, allowing user's to essentially "Set it and forget it", letting the app worry about it for you. There are also features that show nearby mechanics in the area, and a dashboard with current mileage. Mileage can be inputted either manually or by taking a picture of your car's odometer. 

Working on this project was the first time I got to work with a group of people on a serious, long-term project. Our team built the application up from the conceptual phase all the way to an Alpha build that we presented for our faculty's capstone competition. I learned a lot about communicating within a team, handling conflicts, and keeping up with strict deadlines with a group of team mates relying on me. I got to play a full stack role within the project. I designed most of the UI by crafting wireframes, and adjusted them according to my teammates critiques. I also worked with SwiftUI to bring these designes to life and make them interactive. This was the first time I've ever used the framework, so I was learning as I went along. For the backend, I contributed to a gateway service running with NodeJS and Express that funneled all requests to the 3 Spring Boot microservices we had running, into a single endpoint, and allowed these services to interact with eachother.
