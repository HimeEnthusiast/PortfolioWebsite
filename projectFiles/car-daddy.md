Sprout is a mock e-commerce store that I created in Vue and Spring Boot. Users can browse items and add them to their cart for purchase. The cart will keep track of the users items and the quantities.It is possible to check out as both a guest or a registered user. Registering an account will allow a user to keep an online record of their orders as well as previously used payment methods and addresses if they choose to save those. Otherwise, users will recieve a receipt of their order by email nonetheless. /// I originally began this project because I wanted to learn how to use Vue and Laravel. But, at the same time I was taking a class at school where I learned about Spring Boot. I found it really enjoyable so I wanted to make my own project with it outside of class. So I eventually switched the backend over, while continuing with Vue on the frontend. Sprout has been my largest project so far, with the most time spent on it. It was actually a recreation of a project I made in a C# class, but I lacked the time to do everything I wanted. 

Some of the most prominent issues I faced in development were with frontend design and understanding errors from the web service, as well as porting everything over to the production server. I knew from the beginning that I wanted a full store, but I overlooked a few of the pages that I needed to design, so they ended up looking quite plain and needed to be remade later on. The web service caused a lot of trouble, having to deal with permissions and making sure I was sending data properly for it to work, which ended up becoming a problem again after moving to production because methods that worked on my machine, for some reason stopped working on the server.
